Its objective was to provide instructions and research facilities in various disciplines of engineering and technology and the advancement of learning and dissemination of knowledge in each such discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first admission to five year B.Sc. (Engg.) degree course was made by the Institute in July, 1963 at Punjab Engineering College , Chandigarh and Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, w:st="on"Patiala , with an intake of 60 students at each place. This was repeated in July, 1964 also.  The Institute started functioning on its present campus at Kurukshetra from the year 1965-66.  The students were admitted to the first year of the five year integrated B.Sc.(Engg.) degree courses in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. In 1967-68, M.Sc. (Engg.) degree courses in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering were introduced. In 1971-72, a degree course in Electronics & Communication Engineering and a Post-graduate Diploma Course in Scientific Instrumentation were started. In 1976-77, part time M.Sc. (Engg.) degree courses in Electronics & Communication Engineering and Instrumentation Engineering were started. The first registration for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology was done in July, 1967.
